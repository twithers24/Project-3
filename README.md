This is the map required for project 5.

The location that is pre loaded is Amalfi, Campania. A very beautiful place with many attractions to keep you busy.  

The app starts with some of those places marked, with the blue ballon markers. 

Clicking on a location in the list will bring up map information if avaliable, so feel free to scroll though the list.


The search bar was succesfully configured, so it is fully functional.  

This project seemed easy intially, but it required a little more focus than I anticipated.  It was an excellent workout for my brain though. I still stumble my way through creating my functions, but it is becoming more routine for me.
