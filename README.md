Hello gamers! We have a great game that is sure to keep you entertained. This Javascript based game will tickle your itch for the classic Frogger game!!! Making it to the water ensures vistory, and the game resets for your endless pleasure.

Directions to play: left arrow moves left. Right arrow moves right. Up arrow moves up. Down arrow moves the character down.  Watch out for the bugs going different speeds, because if the player and bug collides the game resets. 

Go ahead and play as many times as you like it is on the house!!! Enjoy!!!
